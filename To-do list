will fill this out when i get home
would be great if you could add any of your own stuff also :)

add backdrop / background to sketch
initialise draw() function in sketch file
create game start and end functions
add class specific parameters / functions to fruit and bomb classes
add music (will leave that to you)
create images for fruit and bomb objects
create images for animations
allow sword and fruit classes to work with each other
all i can think of right now will add more later
